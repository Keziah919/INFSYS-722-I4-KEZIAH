Format:
The watrer pollution dataset is in CSV format.
There are a total of 3,276 entries or rows, each representing an individual water sample's test result.
The dataset comprises 10 columns, each a variable pertaining to water quality or portability.
Fields:
ph: The pH value of the water (scale of 0-14), reflecting how acidic or basic the water is. This is a continuous variable and there are missing values that will need to be addressed. WHO has recommended maximum permissible limit of pH from 6.5 to 8.5. The current investigation ranges were 6.52–6.83 which are in the range of WHO standards.

Hardness: A measure of the concentration of calcium and magnesium in water, usually measured in mg/L. The length of time water is in contact with hardness producing material helps determine how much hardness there is in raw water. Hardness was originally defined as the capacity of water to precipitate soap caused by Calcium and Magnesium.

Solids (Total dissolved solids - TDS): The amount of minerals, salts, metals, cations, or anions dissolved in water. This is a continuous variable. The water with high TDS value indicates that water is highly mineralized. Desirable limit for TDS is 500 mg/l and maximum limit is 1000 mg/l which prescribed for drinking purpose.

Chloramines: The amount of chloramines present in the water, measured in mg/L. Chloramines are disinfectants used to treat drinking water. Chlorine and chloramine are the major disinfectants used in public water systems. Chloramines are most commonly formed when ammonia is added to chlorine to treat drinking water. Chlorine levels up to 4 milligrams per liter (mg/L or 4 parts per million (ppm)) are considered safe in drinking water.

Sulfate: Concentration of sulfate compounds in water, measured in mg/L. Presence of missing values noted. Sulfates are naturally occurring substances that are found in minerals, soil, and rocks. They are present in ambient air, groundwater, plants, and food. The principal commercial use of sulfate is in the chemical industry. Sulfate concentration in seawater is about 2,700 milligrams per liter (mg/L). It ranges from 3 to 30 mg/L in most freshwater supplies, although much higher concentrations (1000 mg/L) are found in some geographic locations.

Conductivity: The electrical conductivity of the water, which indicates the water's ability to conduct electricity and is influenced by the presence of inorganic dissolved solids. Pure water is not a good conductor of electric current rather’s a good insulator. Increase in ions concentration enhances the electrical conductivity of water. Generally, the amount of dissolved solids in water determines the electrical conductivity. Electrical conductivity (EC) actually measures the ionic process of a solution that enables it to transmit current. According to WHO standards, EC value should not exceeded 400 μS/cm.

Organic_carbon: A measure of the amount of organic carbon in the water, measured in mg/L. It’s used as an indicator of water quality. Total Organic Carbon (TOC) in source waters comes from decaying natural organic matter (NOM) as well as synthetic sources. TOC is a measure of the total amount of carbon in organic compounds in pure water. According to US EPA < 2 mg/L as TOC in treated / drinking water, and < 4 mg/Lit in source water which is use for treatment.

Trihalomethanes: Chemicals found in water treated with chlorine, measured in μg/L. The presence of missing values is noted. THMs are chemicals which may be found in water treated with chlorine. The concentration of THMs in drinking water varies according to the level of organic material in the water, the amount of chlorine required to treat the water, and the temperature of the water that is being treated. THM levels up to 80 ppm is considered safe in drinking water.

Turbidity: The measure of the degree to which water loses its transparency due to the presence of suspended particulates. The higher the turbidity, the murkier the water appears. The turbidity of water depends on the quantity of solid matter present in the suspended state. It is a measure of light emitting properties of water and the test is used to indicate the quality of waste discharge with respect to colloidal matter. The mean turbidity value obtained for Wondo Genet Campus (0.98 NTU) is lower than the WHO recommended value of 5.00 NTU.

Potability: A binary variable indicating whether the water is safe for human consumption where 1 represents potable and 0 represents not potable.
